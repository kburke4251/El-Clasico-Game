	EL CLASICO
Lionel Messi and his team, Barcelona, have fought hard throughout the season to earn their place in the Champions League final. 
They have a real chance if winning but only one thing stands in their way, Real Madrid.
An El Clasico Champions League final would be one of the most watched sporting events ever.
It is your job to score the goals to win the match before Sergio Ramos comes in to score.
