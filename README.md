## Backstory

Lionel Messi and his team, Barcelona, have fought hard throughout the season to earn their place in the Champions League final. They have a real chance if winning but only one thing stands in their way, Real Madrid. An El Clasico Champions League final would be one of the most watched sporting events ever. It is your job to score the goals to win the match before Sergio Ramos comes in to score. 

### Objective
Try to score 3 goals and win the Champions League before Sergio Ramos tackles you 3 times.

### Instructions
Space to begin playing. Arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right. Space to shoot. Hit the goalkeepers 3 times to stop them from defending the goals. Shoot at the goal 3 times to score and increase your points by 1. Space to restart after the game has finished. Escape (ESC) key to exit.

### Scoring
Once you hit a goal 3 times, it is taken out of the game and you gain one point. If you are "tackled" by Sergio Ramos, the computer gains a point. The first one to 3 points wins. If more than 40% of your shots hit something, you will gain unlimited points at the end.
